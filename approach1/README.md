# Approach 1: Naive approach for type prediction
This approach uses a multi-class classifier in order to predict the most specific
type for each resource. From this most specific type, we can compute the *parent*
types from the ontology class hierarchy.
Our study started with a simple approximation: as we know that the types of most typed resources have a
*logical* path, knowing the most specific (detailed/deeper) type we can compute
the whole type path. Therefore, this approach tries to predict this most specific
class. For this approach we add only one column to the
common training set: the column entitled Class. 

As shown in the figure, for
resource Cervantes we have type Writer and for resource Spain we have type Country, because
these are their most specific types.
In this approach we have used 3 different training methods: Nave Bayes, Random Forest and Deep Learning (multi-layer feedforward).
