# Predicting DBpedia types

This project contains the source code of the set of models for inferrying new types on DBpedia 3.9, exploiting its class hierarchy.

Every original R script has been upload into this repository at "/Rscripts_withoutCleaning". The code has been refactored in order to foster the reutilization and review of every approach.
